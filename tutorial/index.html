		<h3>Reminding everyone how to do the most painful installation of their lives.</h3>

			<li>
				<h4>Download the newest version of Android Studio... </h4>
			</li>
			<p>To do this, click <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" target=”_blank”>here</a> to go to the website and click the download button. And, don't worry, this link will open in a new window.</p>
			<p>When the file with the hard-drive icon is done downloading, click on it. This will open an Android Studio installer. From there, a window with the Android Studio app icon on the left and your applications folder on the right will apear. Drag Android Studio into the applications folder, and then double click android studio.</p>
			<p>Another window will pop up asking you a series of questions about how you want Android Studio to run. Just watch the video and click the buttons that they did- they seem to know what they're doing.</p>

				<h4>Get up to date on the Android SDK...</h4>
			</li>
			<p>Okay- now we should install the version of Android that the phones are using. To do this, click on the configure button at the bottom of the home page. From here, there should be a dropdown that should appear. Click the 'SDK Manager' option from the Dropdown. </p>

			<br>
			<p>A window should appear displaying different versions of Android. We have to find the version of Android that we are running on the phones. <strike>Clearly we are running the newest version of Android on our phones because we are such a modern team in a modern competition, so install Android version 10.0.0.</strike> We are running Android version 7.1.1 on the phones, so click that box, and then press the apply button at the bottom.</p>
