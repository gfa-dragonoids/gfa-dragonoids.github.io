<p>Today, Ethan and Will set up the motors and sprockets to allow the are to rotate upwards. They also 3D printed a part to hold the D-shaft. The rotation of the arm enables it to sit horizontally at first. When the arm is horizontal, the robot is under 14 inches, which allows it to drive under the red and blue skybridges. This will allow us to score more points during the autonomous period.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-center"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5MhUx6YaAGZR5dmIDkiTysJ9On5fri9IknfBAEAYeZOqfM8m1RrTU_6LsAaOtBlh_EP73dyaY48Zx5-JdiK1z0HHuFWetOCP51wRAvLyYw48nIJj3IFR-0vVYKivxr2Ff2u_qYFB" height="435" width="326"></p><p><br></p>
