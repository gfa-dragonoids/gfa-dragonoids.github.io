<p>During the team meetings today the team set up a schedule for the beginning of the season. The team worked out how we could properly utilize the space that since we were only able to access it for a day or so every week. Captain, Andrew Wagner, worked on making a presentation for the 15 new members that signed up for robotics. The presentation included a team viewing of the tech challenge this year, our ideas of two teams, and will end with driving the robot that was built last year. After the meeting, the team will send out an email to the members that attended asking what days work best for them.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/j2y346poiydikHeKLuK4X-fHzxvnTqkilIy6kpeFVsTOsBubcQtFViuRqIkQn2_s1Ki0N2BWOBKIT0gVqV_YerZlo3Q7X0yekCR02TkUT7Idx7oRcdcnJs5dWdoPDb6S3TD9BxcN" height="357" width="624"></p>
