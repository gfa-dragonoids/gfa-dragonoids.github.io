<p>Will, William, and Ethan practiced driving and building towers with the robot in order to gain some experience and look at any errors that occurred. There were several issues that they encountered, including room for error on pickup and dropoff, strafing in a straight line, and building an actual tower. To begin, the mouth of the lift was constructed so that it did not have to open side-to-side to collect and deposit stones. This had initially been a bonus, as it limited the moving parts, but quickly became a hindrance as it took precise maneuvering to pick up the stones.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/4oju2ESjKjuvT0UlAMU07LdigfVtL8Z4LVHtqISwVrQ1AlKNUn5RabTVrtHHxnwogPF--Ulz1eZ866VwT_3d-aUquVzFzmxyzn1eoq6mHyRLQC9QhAJRjModYXcLrpwjEKzfJJwZ" height="395" width="296"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3oWbN4hbEHdponTti1LWkNlXMhCV34tZQsAfrMh3X-EpVHr_9EuP1VvfQxlGVKLSs0kT8gLc2pNLMbpSYKawocxyZhsiEJSpOCC_yO0-g23kVUfEv2yXebq9kYkFGAf5pYMU65uu" height="205" width="274"></strong></p><p><br></p><p>However, Will make quick improvement and learned some strategies to grasping stones with the robot. Additionally, the strafing was not initially easy to control as the robot would slide in a slight curve instead of directly side-to-side. Will also made quick progress with this, accounting for the natural turn and building a habit of counteracting it. As a final obstacle for this practice, the towers that they attempted to build would often topple as the robot deposited a stone slightly too low. William and Ethan were able to improve with this over time by getting a more intuitive feel for the exact spot a stone had to be before it was dropped.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
